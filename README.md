## :computer: :lock: **learn-php** :lock: :computer:
This is a web-based application project focused on **Server-Side Scripting** using Native PHP.
This project implements dynamic functionality, session management, and database interactions. 

The core objective is to understand how backend logic works without relying on heavy frameworks, managing data flow between the client and the server securely.

> This project is created strictly for **educational purposes**. It is intended to demonstrate core programming concepts and is not designed for production use.

**Key Features Implemented:**
* **Authentication:** User Login & Registration system (`login.php`, `register.php`).
* **Session Management:** Secure access to dashboard using PHP Sessions.
* **User Management:** Change password and user details (`changepass.php`, `changeuser.php`).
* **Media Handling:** Image upload functionality (`upload.php`, `gallery.php`).
* **Templating:** Modular code structure using header/footer layouts (`layout/`).
